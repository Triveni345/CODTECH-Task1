Overview of The Project:
This Python project is a simple command-line calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select a mathematical operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. After that, the program computes the result of the selected operation and displays it to the user.

The program will first ask the user to enter two numeric values. These values should be treated as floats to accommodate both integer and decimal numbers.
Operation Selection:

The program will then present a menu with four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
The user will choose which operation they wish to perform by entering the corresponding number.
Computation:

Based on the user's choice, the program will execute the appropriate arithmetic operation using the two input numbers.
It will handle division by zero by displaying a friendly error message if the user tries to divide by zero.

After the operation is performed, the result will be displayed to the user.
